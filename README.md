# üìö What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of language models by combining them with retrieval mechanisms. Instead of depending solely on the pre-trained knowledge within a model, RAG retrieves real-time, relevant data from external sources such as APIs, web pages, or document databases. This approach ensures the generated responses are more accurate, contextually rich, and grounded in reliable information.



# ü§ñ What is an Agent in LangChain?
An Agent is a sophisticated system within LangChain that acts as a decision-making layer. It interprets user queries, determines which tools (retrievers, APIs, or external services) are required to process the query, and then synthesizes the retrieved information into a coherent response.

In this project, the agent plays a critical role in:

‚Ä¢ Binding the Google Generative AI LLM with tools such as Wikipedia and Arxiv APIs.

‚Ä¢ Orchestrating a seamless interaction between user inputs, external data sources, and the language model to provide informed and accurate outputs.

‚Ä¢ Utilizing LangChain‚Äôs ability to format responses and handle intermediate steps.




# üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1.Environment Configuration:

‚Ä¢ The project uses google.generativeai and langchain_community modules to interact with Google Generative AI and external tools.

‚Ä¢ Environment variables (API keys) are loaded via dotenv to securely access external services.

### 2.Document Loading and Splitting:

‚Ä¢ A WebBaseLoader is used to fetch documents from a specific URL.

‚Ä¢ The loaded documents are split into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for effective retrieval and embedding.

### 3.Embeddings and Vector Store:


‚Ä¢ Google Generative AI Embeddings are generated for the document chunks using the embedding-001 model.

‚Ä¢ A FAISS Vector Store is created to facilitate fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information.

### 4.Tool Integration:

‚Ä¢ Wikipedia API Wrapper: Retrieves concise summaries from Wikipedia for user queries.

‚Ä¢ Arxiv API Wrapper: Fetches and summarizes scientific papers based on user input.

‚Ä¢ Custom Retriever Tool: Searches the loaded documents for information about LangSmith using the FAISS retriever.

### 5.Prompt Design and LLM Binding:

‚Ä¢ A ChatPromptTemplate is defined to format user inputs and responses into structured prompts for the language model.

‚Ä¢ The Google Generative AI Chat model (gemini-pro) is initialized and bound to the defined tools.

### 6.Agent Execution:

‚Ä¢ The agent uses the tools to handle queries such as:

‚Ä¢ Retrieving details about LangSmith from the custom document loader.

‚Ä¢ Fetching scientific paper summaries from Arxiv.

‚Ä¢ Providing general knowledge answers using Wikipedia.

‚Ä¢ Outputs are formatted using LangChain‚Äôs OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser.



# üåü Key Features of This Project

‚Ä¢ Combines Google Generative AI with retrieval-based tools for real-time, reliable information generation.

‚Ä¢ Implements multiple data sources (Wikipedia, Arxiv, and custom web documents) for diverse query handling.

‚Ä¢ Leverages LangChain‚Äôs Agent Framework to intelligently select tools and process user inputs.

‚Ä¢ Provides a reusable and extensible architecture for Retrieval-Augmented Generation tasks.


#### This system demonstrates how agents can be used within RAG to build scalable, robust, and domain-specific AI solutions.
